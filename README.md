# Bird Encyclopedia - learning to build a website in php

I am learning the basics of CRUD object orientated PHP by creating a table of bird species where you can add, delete, edit and view individually details about birds.  

In this branch I am building upon the OOP I did prior and add the ability to login/logout and register.
